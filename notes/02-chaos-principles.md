# 02 â€” Core Principles of Chaos Engineering

**Principles**
- Start from steady state: define normal behavior first.
- Hypothesis-driven experiments: state what you expect to happen.
- Minimize blast radius: run in controlled environments and incrementally increase scope.
- Automate and repeat experiments.
- Learn and harden: capture learnings and close remediation loops.
