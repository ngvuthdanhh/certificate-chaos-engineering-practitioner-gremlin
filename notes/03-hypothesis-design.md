# 03 â€” Hypothesis Design and Experiment Planning

**Components of a good hypothesis**
- Clear steady-state metric (e.g., request latency < 200ms).
- Specific failure mode (e.g., 30% CPU on service X).
- Expected outcome (e.g., graceful degradation, not outage).

**Experiment checklist**
- Scope, blast radius, rollback plan, monitoring, stakeholders, authorization.
