# Lab â€” Resilience Validation (Capstone)

## Objective
Design and execute a validation plan that proves an SLO is resilient to a set of failure modes.

## Steps
1. Choose SLO and baseline metrics.
2. Define 3 failure scenarios (CPU, network, pod kill).
3. Run each scenario with controlled blast radius.
4. Capture metrics and produce a final report with remediation tasks.

## Deliverable
- Final report (hypothesis, attack config, results, remediation)
- Post-experiment action list
