# Glossary

- **Chaos Engineering** — Discipline of experimenting on systems to build confidence in system behavior under turbulent conditions.  
- **Blast Radius** — The set of systems/users that could be affected by an experiment.  
- **Attack** — A Gremlin action (CPU spike, latency, pod kill).  
- **Hypothesis** — A testable statement about system behavior under failure.  
- **SLO / SLI** — Service Level Objective / Indicator used for measuring reliability.  
- **Observability** — Ability to infer system internal state via telemetry (logs/metrics/traces).
