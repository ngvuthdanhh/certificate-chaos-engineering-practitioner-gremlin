# Chaos Engineering Practitioner â€” Gremlin

**Course summary**
This training teaches the principles and practical application of Chaos Engineering using Gremlin. Learners will design safe experiments, inject controlled failures, observe system behavior, and operationalize resilience improvements.

**Audience**
- SREs, DevOps engineers, platform engineers, reliability engineers, cloud architects.
- Security engineers interested in resilience testing.

**Learning outcomes**
- Design hypothesis-driven chaos experiments.
- Use Gremlin to execute safe failure injections.
- Build robust observability and SLO-based validation.
- Integrate chaos experiments in CI/CD and incident readiness.

**How to use this repository**
- Read `docs/` and `notes/` to learn theory.
- Perform labs in `labs/` in isolated environments only.
- Use `extras/` for case studies and further learning.
