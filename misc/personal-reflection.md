# Personal Reflection

**Author:** Thành Danh  
**Program:** Chaos Engineering Practitioner — Gremlin  

> This section summarizes my learning journey, challenges, and insights from applying chaos engineering.

### Key takeaways
- Building resilience is a cultural and technical challenge.
- The value of safe experimentation over fear of failure.
- Observability is as critical as injection.

### Next steps
- Apply chaos practices in red team simulations.
- Explore integrations between Gremlin and security testing pipelines.
- Publish a technical write-up on controlled failure simulation.
